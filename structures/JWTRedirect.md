## Store Code Parameter
The `storeCode` parameter is provided to allow the E-Commerce platform to keep track of orders arriving from a particular store & display device, and additionally a reference to an employee via a 4 digit number. Simply split the storeCode at the '-' to receive each part: i.e. `MELCENTRAL2-0100` References device `MELCENTRAL2` and the retail associate code `100`.

## Mode Parameter
The `mode` parameter is provided to find out if the device/user selected `paypal` as a checkout method, if so, attempt to automatically redirect the user, or `manual` - where the e-commerce platform should simply present the populated cart, ready to begin the checkout process.
